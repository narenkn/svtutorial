<a id="x3-2000"></a>Preface</h2> My interest in <span class="ec-lmtt-10x-x-109">System Verilog </span>started during late 2004, when the
language was being defined. Back then the only reference available was the LRM
itself, as primitive implementations of the language started to surface in
commercial tools. As I learnt the language, I started understanding the language
from inside-out which made a big difference to the code I was writing. Though
many texts on the subject are effective in conveying concepts of the language as
explaination of limited examples, the focus of this book would be to teach
nuances of <span class="ec-lmtt-10x-x-109">System Verilog </span>with utmost examples as possible. Such a method
would aid even the novice of engineers to pick up the language without much
difficuilty.
